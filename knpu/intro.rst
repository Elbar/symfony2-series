Welcome to Symfony!
===================

Welcome to the first ever KnpUniversity screencast!

We're talking all about Symfony2. A lot has changed in the PHP and Symfony
world over the past few years, so let's look at some facts:

**Symfony is a component library**

This means that you can use any part of it as a standalone library in any
PHP project. For example, you could use Symfony's Router in a flat PHP app
to get flexible URLs.

**Symfony is also a "framework"**

Because most of us don't want to worry about making a bunch of libraries work
together, we have the Symfony framework. This is one "suggestion" of how all
of its components can work together in a consistent system. In this screencast,
we'll be building an app in the Symfony framework. Silex, a popular PHP microframework,
is another example of a framework built using the Symfony components.

**Symfony plays nice with others**

Symfony follows some standards that make it effortless to include and use
other libraries in your project. Want to use a component of Zend Framework?
That's possible with one line of code.

**Symfony is the most watched PHP project on GitHub**

So there's a lot of us out there working with it.

In this screencast, we'll start building an events application using the
Symfony2 Framework. One of the bonuses of learning Symfony is that the most
important concepts are the same across all frameworks, and really web apps
in general. So, while you're developing in Symfony, you're really learning
about web best-practices in general, and, most likely becoming a better developer.

For this screencast, we have a few goals:

1) Start a new project using Symfony2

2) Explore the core areas of the framework, like routing, controllers, requests, responses, and templating

3) Get comfortable with a few extra tools, like Doctrine for dealing with the database and code generation tools

4) Learn best practices and tips along the way

Ready? Let's go!

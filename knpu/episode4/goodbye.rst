Goodbye Friend!
===============

Now that you know how to deploy your application, why are you still listening
to me? The past 4 screencasts have taken us through at least 3 galaxies and
we want to thank you for joining us. At this point, you've touched on just
about every part of Symfony, including some more advanced topics. That means
that you're well on your way to creating whatever you need to in Symfony2!
But the web is a complex world, and you'll certainly run into new problems
that will require new solutions. When you do, be sure to check out Symfony's
cookbook, which is packed with articles on specific, and often much more advanced
topics.

We also hope that you'll join us again in the future as we cover more PHP
and Symfony topics. Have an idea? We'd love to hear it.

Thank you, and see you next time!

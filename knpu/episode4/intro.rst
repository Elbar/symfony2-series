The Final Stretch
=================

Ok guys, welcome to the last episode. I'm not going to bore you with a lot
of introduction, I'd rather get to work. But I will say that you've come
a long way through the first 3 episodes and understand all the really important
parts of Symfony, like routes, controllers and services. Here in episode 4,
we're going to round things out by learning more about forms, handling assets
and how we can get our app up to production.

And hey, don't get lazy on my now. Code along with the tutorial - it'll make
a huge difference.

Ok, I can't wait any longer - let's go!

Introduction!
=============

Welcome back for the 4th and final part of our Starting in Symfony2 series!
If you've been with us since episode 1, then you've come a long long way
young Jedi, from creating routes and controllers to creating services and
Doctrine listeners. That's awesome, and we've just got a little bit further
to go.

In this screencast, we'll round-out just a few areas that we haven't talked
about yet. First, we're going to explore assets - how you should include CSS
and JS files and how we can do cool things with CDN's and cache busting. This
will set us up to discuss Assetic - a wonderful library for processing and
combining our assets. With these sections behind you, you'll be able to do
just about anything with your static files.

Afterwards, we'll revisit form theming and show how we can customize form
rendering to work automatically with Twitter Bootstrap. This is important
for 2 reasons. First, theming will allow you to write clean templates that
render exactly how you want. Second, we're going to learn a lot about the
machine that renders forms, which will give you a lot of power when working
with them.

Finally, we'll talk about deployment: the necessary steps and some options
you have for automating your deployment process.

As always, we strongly encourage you to code along with us and to stop the
video and explore things that interest you. I hope you're getting more and
more comfortable diving into Symfony's source code when you need to, this
will be a great skill that will serve you in the future.

Ok, I can't wait any longer - let's go!

title:  Starting in Symfony2: Episode 4 (2.4+)
length: 0:40:25
summary: |
    Welcome back for part 4 of our Starting in Symfony2 series! We've got
    some really important topics planned and we're going to start with mastering
    assets and the Assetic library. We'll bust cache, minimize our CSS & JS
    files and get you ready to do just about anything with your static assets.
    We'll also dive much deeper into form rendering - customizing our forms
    to work with Twitter Bootstrap and learning a lot more about the powerful
    and advanced mechanisms behind form theming. Finally, we'll cover deployment:
    what steps are always necessary and some options for automating the process.
    Let's do this!

    Highlights:

    * The Twig asset function
    * More about Dependency Injection Parameters and the purpose of parameters.yml
    * Cache busting with assets_version and assets_version_format
    * Introduction to Assetic
    * Assetic filters, including cssrewrite, cssmin and the apply_to option
    * Dumping assets in the prod and dev environments and the secret of turning use_controllers to false
    * The basics of form customization and theming
    * FormView "variables" - what they are and how you can use them to do just about anything while customizing how a form renders
    * Using the finishView to control FormView "variables"
    * The steps and best practices for deployment with tips on automating the process
